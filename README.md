# **Match the Hearts - Valentine's Memory Game**

Welcome to the **Match the Hearts** game! This is a fun, Valentine's-themed memory game where you flip cards to find matching pairs of love-themed messages. This project is designed to help you learn **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** in a hands-on way.

As we progress through the course, weâ€™ll build this game step-by-step, breaking down the code into smaller, manageable activities. By the end, youâ€™ll have a fully functional game and a solid understanding of programming fundamentals!

     git clone https://github.com/your-username/match-the-hearts.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd match-the-hearts
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the game in action.
   - Use a code editor (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) to view and edit the code.

3. **Follow Along in Class**

## **Class Activities Breakdown**

Weâ€™ll break the game into smaller activities and implement them as the course progresses. Hereâ€™s the plan:

### **Activity 1: Setting Up the HTML and CSS**
- **Goal**: Create the basic structure and style of the game.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write the HTML for the game board, cards, and reset button.
  - Add CSS to style the game and make it visually appealing.
- **Outcome**: A static game board with cards that donâ€™t do anything yet.

### **Activity 2: Adding JavaScript Basics**
- **Goal**: Introduce JavaScript and dynamically generate the game board.
- **Tasks**:
  - Use JavaScript to create and shuffle the cards.
  - Dynamically add the cards to the game board.
- **Outcome**: A game board with shuffled cards.

### **Activity 3: Handling Card Clicks**
- **Goal**: Add interactivity to the game.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add an event listener to handle card clicks.
  - Flip the cards when clicked.
- **Outcome**: Cards flip when clicked, but no matching logic yet.

### **Activity 4: Checking for Matches**
- **Goal**: Implement the logic to check if two flipped cards match.
- **Tasks**:
  - Track flipped cards and check if they match.
  - If they match, keep them flipped; otherwise, flip them back.
- **Outcome**: Basic matching functionality is implemented.

### **Activity 5: Winning the Game**
- **Goal**: Add logic to detect when all pairs are matched.
- **Tasks**:
  - Track matched cards.
  - Display a message when all pairs are matched.
- **Outcome**: A fully functional memory game!

### **Activity 6: Adding a Reset Button**
- **Goal**: Allow players to reset the game.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add a reset button to shuffle the cards and start over.
- **Outcome**: Players can restart the game at any time.
